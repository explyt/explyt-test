Here we would like to introduce some key features of our plugin and to explain how to call them.

### Generating scenarios

Select a target (a method or a class) you would like to generate tests for and click on a gutter icon. <br>
If a potential target does not have a gutter, it means that no meaningful tests can be generated for it.

New scenarios are generated for you. After that call test generation again.
