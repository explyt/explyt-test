## About 

Your teammate for coding, testing, and debugging, Explyt plugin increases test coverage, integrates tests into the existing code base, understands the project structure and follows its style. Supports Java and Kotlin projects, including Spring-based applications.

Explyt improves code quality and makes test writing less time-consuming and more comfortable for developers. 

## What makes Explyt unique?

Explyt is not yet another wrapper for prompts to popular LLM providers. The tool consists of several stages, each refining the results of the previous one.

First, the project environment and file context are collected, filtered, prioritized, and passed to the LLM model. This intelligent model finds the right prompt for the specific circumstance, such as Unit Test generation with JUnit 5 or Spring MockMVC tests.

Second, the template is generated with a fine-tuned AI model.

Next, the template is filled with mixed static and dynamic code analysis in the feedback loop. Static code analysis (and specifically symbolic execution) allows you to run code and find problems without actual code execution, while dynamic code analysis relies on running instrumented code.

Our benchmarking system constantly improves the quality of generated tests.
